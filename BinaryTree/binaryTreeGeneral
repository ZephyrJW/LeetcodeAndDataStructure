Each node has at most two child nodes.

Special binary trees:
1. Complete Binary Tree
Each level must be filled except for the last level, which all nodes are as far left as possible.

2. Binary Search Tree (BST)
For each node, its value is larger than all its left descendents and is smaller than all its right descendents.

3. Binary Heap (A complete tree)
Is either Min Heap or Max Heap. In a Min Binary Heap, the key at root must be minimum among all keys present in Binary Heap. The same property must be recursively true for all nodes in Binary Tree.
How to represent a Binary Heap?
	A binary heap is typically represented as array.
	- The root element will be at arr[0]
	- parent node: arr[(i-1)/2]
	- left child node: arr[2*i+1]
	- right child node: arr[2*i+2]
